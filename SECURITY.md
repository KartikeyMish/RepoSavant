# RepoSavant Security Policy

Hey there, fellow coder! üòÑ At RepoSavant, we're all about making GitHub even cooler, but we're also dead serious about keeping things safe and sound. If you stumble upon a security glitch, we're here to hear you out and fix it up. Here's how you can be our superhero:

## Reporting a Security Issue

So, you've got a hunch that something's not quite right? Awesome! But before you yell it from the digital rooftops, let's keep it on the down-low. Follow these steps:

1. **Shhh... Keep it Secret:** Please, don't blast the issue on Twitter or any public forum. We appreciate your discretion.

2. **Shoot Us an Email:** Drop a friendly note to our security squad at [kartikeymishra626@gmail.com](mailto:kartikeymishra626@gmail.com) with the deets:
   - Give us the lowdown on what's bugging you.
   - Share how you stumbled upon it if you can.
   - Let us know what havoc (if any) this could wreak.
   - And, of course, tell us how to reach you back.

3. **Encrypt for Extra Secret Sauce:** If you're sending sensitive info, sprinkle some encryption magic using our [PGP key](https://reposavant.com/security/pgp-key).

4. **What Happens Next:** We'll give you a virtual high-five within [time frame] business days. We'll team up to squash the bug, keep you in the loop, and get your name in the hall of fame (if you want).

## Disclosure Dance

- We promise to give you a virtual hug (or handshake) within [time frame] business days.
- We'll keep you posted as we work our magic.
- If you want your name in lights (or just a thank you note), we'll make it happen.
- We'll coordinate with you to unveil the issue at just the right moment.

## Legal Mumbo Jumbo

We promise not to sue you if you play nice and follow the rules. Deal? üòé

## Code of Conduct

While you're here, play fair:
- No peeking at others' data without permission.
- No exploiting glitches for evil (seriously, don't be that guy/gal).
- And don't do anything that'll land you in digital jail.

## Our Promise

We're on a mission to make GitHub amazing and secure. We couldn't do it without your help. Thanks for having our back and keeping the code world a safer place.

P.S. This security policy might get a makeover, so check out the latest version on our [security page](https://reposavant.com/security) whenever you're in the mood for some light reading.

Happy coding and stay safe out there! üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
